      Below is an example of our ASCII 'snd' files that we use for input into 
      LAPS. The filename for this is '961581200.snd' (yydddhhmm). We store 
      one of these time stamped files for each analysis cycle in the 
      'nest7grid/lapsprd/snd' directory. The time stamp on the SND file should
      thus match the 'systime.dat' file. A reliable way to populate these files
      is to call the subroutine 'write_snd' located in this directory.

      The first row contains Station ID, # of levels, lat, lon (- is West), 
      elevation (meters above MSL), and identifier. This is in a set format 
      as shown below.

      write(11,511,err=998)
     1             wmostanum(isnd),n_good_levels,stalat(isnd)
     1            ,stalon(isnd),staelev(isnd),(staname(ic,isnd),ic=1,5)       
     1            ,a9time_raob,c8_obstype

  511 format(i12,i12,f11.4,f15.4,f15.0,1x,5a1,3x,a9,1x,a8)

      The subsequent rows contain (in free format) height (meters-MSL), 
      pressure (mb), temperature (C), Dewpoint (C), Wind Direction (Deg), Wind 
      Speed (m/s). The missing data flag is 1e37. Please note that in some cases 
      the height is given but not the pressure. On rare occasions, we may have 
      the pressure, but not the height. In the ideal situation, we would like 
      to have both heights and pressures for all the levels. This can be tricky 
      as the raw RAOB data may have one or the other depending on whether it 
      is mandatory, significant wind, or significant temperature / dewpoint 
      data. The analyses will do their best to fill in missing heights or
      pressures as long as one of them is available.

      Note that all the RAOB mandatory and significant levels must be 
      interleaved together and sorted by increasing height (decreasing  
      pressure). 
   
      The 'snd' files may contain some soundings that lie outside the LAPS 
      domain. These are generally screened out during the analysis step.

      Allowed values of 'obstype' are as follows:

                           'RAOB    ' 
                           'SATSND  '
                           'GOES12  '
                           'DROPSND '

      The 'a9time' is the time the balloon is in the mid-troposphere, or
      release time plus 30min.

      There can be as many observations in a particular SND file
      as you want. The only limitation is that the observation times
      be within +/-laps_cycle_time of the nominal analysis time 
      (in systime.dat). This would ensure that the data fits within the 
      time window checks in the analyses.

      Dropsonde station elevation should probably be set to a missing value
      of -999. I think for IHOP it actually was the height of the lowest 
      sonde measurement. A missing data value (-999.) may work better to 
      ensure that the lowest dropsonde measurement doesn't somehow slip 
      into the surface analyses.

      It is advisable to name dropsondes and satellite soundings with sequential
      names (within each file) to help in tracking their processing in the 
      various log files.
