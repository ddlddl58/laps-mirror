1.  Function
This program reads a set of the LAPS output files and creates a consolidated 
file of GRIB2 messages using the LAPS "A9" format file name (yydddhhmm.gr2).
See WMO publication FM92-XII for the details on the GRIB2 format.

2.  Source code added or modified from ESRL/GSD baseline:

$LAPS_SRC_ROOT/Makefile (added compilation of grib2 lib and laps2grib)
$LAPS_SRC_ROOT/etc/laps_tools.pm  (added creation of lapsprd/gr2 dir)
$LAPS_SRC_ROOT/etc/sched.pl.in  (added execution of laps2grib.exe)

3.  Usage

The program can be used for both LAPS NetCDF output files (lsx, etc) and for 
LAPS processed model NetCDF output files (fsf, fua). Below is the message 
usage statement resulting from running the program.

 ======================================================


3a.  Usage of laps2grib.exe for LAPS output files (lsx, etc)
----------------------------------------------------

The program is run as the last step in the LAPS sched.pl file, and
the LAPS_DATA_ROOT must be set if running by hand.

The execution of the program is controlled by:

$LAPS_DATA_ROOT/static/laps2grib.nl
$LAPS_DATA_ROOT/static/laps2grib.vtab
$LAPS_DATA_ROOT/time/systime.dat 

If you do not want to use the program, set "lrun_laps2grib = .false.'
in the namelist file, and the program will exit immediately.

--- The laps2grib.nl namelist file lets you set the following options

	lrun_laps2grib:  Logical, set to .true. to allow it to run

       	center_id: Integer, set to center ID to use in GRIB PDS

	subcenter_id: Integer, set to subcenter ID to use in GRIB PDS	

 	process_id:  Integer, set to process ID for GRIB PDS

	prod_status: Integer, used to set production status in GRIB PDS
	
        output_path: Set the path for the output file to be written.  Set
                     it to a null string to use the default path, which
                     will be $LAPS_DATA_ROOT/lapsprd/gr2

--- The laps2grib.vtab provides a means for the user
to specify which LAPS variables are selected and output, and how they
will be represented in the GRIB2 message.  A common set of variables
is already configured.  To prevent output of any of the variables
already configured, either delete the line or simply insert a space
or any other character in column 1. (Note: if the filename differs from
"laps2grib.vtab" than use your file's vtable name in the command line,
e.g. laps2grib.exe projectdat2grib.vtab.) 

In this list, you can specify variables that are either 3-dimensional 
(assumed to be on the LAPS pressure grid), or 2-dimensional.  

o To set up a 3D variable, the format is as follows:

3d qbal,ext,var,pmin,pmax,conv_fac,scale_fac,discipline,category,parameter

The "3d" must be exactly as shown and must start in column 1!  The remaining
parameters are defined as such:

qbal: Integer, set to 0 to extract standard LAPS analysis or 1 to use files
      from $LAPS_DATA_ROOT/lapsprd/balance (obviously only applied to some
      of the variables.

ext:  The LAPS extension (lower case) of the file type to use

var:  The LAPS netcdf variable name (lower case) to extract from
      the file type defined in ext.

pmin: Minimum pressure level (Pa) to output to the GRIB file

pmax: Maximum pressure level (Pa) to output to the GRIB file

conv_fac:  The value to multiply the LAPS variable by to make
           it conform to the WMO GRIB2 standard.  In most cases,
           this will be 1.

scale_fac: The scale factor to use in creating the GRIB2 message. This
           is expressed as a power of 10.  The raw data is multiplied by
           this power of 10 before the GRIB compression, so this is how
           you control the precision.  If you have a field with very
           small values (e.g., mixing ratios), you will want to set this
           to a positive value that represents the precision in terms
           of number of decimal places.

discipline: The GRIB2 discipline table to be used.

category:  The GRIB2 parameter category within the discipline to be used.

parameter:  The GRIB2 parameter ID within the category/discipline.

o The 2-dimensional data is similar.  The format is:
2d ext,var,conv_fac,scale_fac,l1t,l1s,l1v,l2t,l2s,l2v,discipline,category,param

o The accumulated 2-dimensional data is similar. The format is:
a2d ext,var,conv_fac,scale_fac,l1t,l1s,l1v,l2t,l2s,l2v,discipline,category,param

NOTE: To extract data from the static.nest7grid file, use "n7g" for the extension!
The parameters that are common with the 3d type have the same definition. In the 
case of the 2d variables, you must specify the level types and values to use as 
such:

l1t:  Type of first level (GRIB2 code table 4.5)
l1s:  Scale factor (power of 10) used to store the level value.  Level values
      are stored as integers, so if your level requires fractions, you need 
      to scale the value and specify the scaling used here.
l1v:  The scaled value of the first level]
l2t/l2s/l2v:  The same as the "l1?" values, but for level 2 in the case of 
      a layered product.  For single level products, these should all be 
      set to 255.


3b.  Usage of laps2grib.exe for LAPS processed model output files (fsf, fua)
----------------------------------------------------

The information as found in the section above (Usage for LAPS output files) 
apply here. Note, additional command line arguments are required that look 
like this:

  laps2grib.exe vtab [hh]hmm forecast_id 

The execution of the program is controlled by:

$LAPS_DATA_ROOT/static/laps2grib.nl (same as above)
$LAPS_DATA_ROOT/static/model2grib.vtab 
$LAPS_DATA_ROOT/time/modeltime.dat 

--- The model2grib.vtab provides means for user to specify the fsf (surface) 
and fua (upper air) model variables to convert. The model vtab file can have 
any naming convention, e.g. "wrf2grib.vtab", etc.

o In the vtab, the format for the model 3d, 2d and accumulated 2d variables 
are as follows:

3d  qbal,fua,var,pmin,pmax,conv_fac,scale_fac,discipline,category,parameter
2d  fsf,var,conv_fac,scale_fac,l1t,l1s,l1v,l2t,l2s,l2v,discipline,category,param
a2d fsf,var,conv_fac,scale_fac,l1t,l1s,l1v,l2t,l2s,l2v,discipline,category,param

Here is an example for surface (fsf) temperature, dew-point and RH:
2d 'fsf','tsf',  1., 1,103, 0, 2,255,255,255,0, 0,  0
2d 'fsf','dsf',  1., 1,103, 0, 2,255,255,255,0, 0,  6
2d 'fsf','rh ',  1., 0,103, 0, 2,255,255,255,0, 1,  1

--- The laps2grib.exe program with model usage creates an output file of GRIB2 
messages using the LAPS "A13" file name format (yydddhhmmffff.gr2), where ffff 
is the forecast hhmm (and in some cases, where fffff is forecast hhhmm). As 
such, the forecast time needs to be specified (as input to the command line) 
as does the forecast domain. For example, there could be several models 
processed by LAPS, e.g. wrf-hrrr, or an ensemble of N-number of members. Each 
model could run out 12 to 144 forecast hours, or longer. E.g.:

	$LAPSROOT/bin/laps2grib.exe wrf2grib.vtab    0 mean
	$LAPSROOT/bin/laps2grib.exe wrf2grib.vtab  300 mean
	$LAPSROOT/bin/laps2grib.exe wrf2grib.vtab  600 mean
	$LAPSROOT/bin/laps2grib.exe wrf2grib.vtab  900 mean
	$LAPSROOT/bin/laps2grib.exe wrf2grib.vtab 1000 mean

The timestamp for the model runtime would be written to 
$LAPS_DATA_ROOT/time/modeltime.dat containing the time format YYJJJHHMM, for 
example, 120051200.
