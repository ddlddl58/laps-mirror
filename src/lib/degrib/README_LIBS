Software Purpose
------------
We have added support for the background models to now include 
Grib-formatted files. This code was developed to allow lga.exe 
to read and process Grib1 and Grib2-formatted files directly
(without needing to convert to NetCDF-format).


Software Requirements
-----------
These libraries have been incorporated into the LAPS code:

g2lib  from http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/codes/GRIB2/
        version 1.0.7.1  (3/29/06)

w3lib  from http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/codes/GRIB2/
        version 1.1  (3/29/06)


These are external libraries that are assumed available
for Grib2 compression:

jasper from http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper/ 
         (called jpeg2000 here)  (3/24/06)

zlib    from http://www.zlib.net
        version 1.2.3  (3/30/06)

libpng   from http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
        version 1.2.8  (3/30/06)

These external compression libraries are usually found in 
/usr/lib. You will need to have a system administrator 
download and install external libraries if they are not 
already installed on your system. 


Software Configure
-----------
The 'configure' script will determine if these compression 
libraries are present. If found, 'configure' prepares the file 
'src/include/makefile.inc' with DEGRIBLIBS and DEGRIBFLAGS 
values allowing lga software to read both Grib1 and Grib2-
formatted files. Without these compression libraries available 
lga.exe can only read Grib1-formatted files. 

Example from 'src/include/makefile.inc' that would build Grib2 
decoding software:

# Grib1 and Grib2 decoder libs and flags
DEGRIBLIBS= -ljasper -lpng -lz
DEGRIBFLAGS= -DUSE_PNG -DUSE_JPEG2000
CDEGRIBFLAGS= -DIBM4


Software Build
------------
Because of dependencies, build lib/w3lib/libw3.a first, 
lib/g2lib/libg2_4.a second and lib/degrib/libdegrib.a third, 
as is done in the top-level Makefile. If the DEGRIBFLAGS 
change, 'make clean' and 'make' all three libraries.


Software Run
-----------
Edit 'static/background.nl'. Set bgmodel=13 for GRIB. Set 
cmodel='GFS', for example. Run lga.exe.

To extract variables from Grib files there is a lookup 
Vtable.XXX file corresponding to each model found in 
data/static/Variable_Tables. Additional GRIB models can be 
processed if you create a vtable for the model patterened like 
the one for Vtable.GFS.


For additional information see the README file in directory 
g2lib.
