	function te(t,td,p)
c
c   this function returns the equivalent temperature te (celsius) of a
c   parcel of air given its temperature t (celsius), dew point (celsius)
c   and pressure p (millibars).

c
c   calculate equivalent potential temperature.
	aoe = oe(t,td,p)
c   use poissons's equation to calculate equivalent temperature.
	te= tda(aoe,p)
	return
