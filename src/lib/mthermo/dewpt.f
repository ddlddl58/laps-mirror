	function dewpt(ew)
c
c   this function yields the dew point dewpt (celsius), given the
c   water vapor pressure ew (millibars).
c
c	baker,schlatter	17-may-1982	original version
c
c   the empirical formula appears in bolton, david, 1980:
c   "the computation of equivalent potential temperature,"
c   monthly weather review, vol. 108, no. 7 (july), p. 1047, eq.(11).
c   the quoted accuracy is 0.03c or less for -35 < dewpt < 35c.
	enl = alog(ew)
	dewpt = (243.5*enl-440.8)/(19.48-enl)
	return
	end
