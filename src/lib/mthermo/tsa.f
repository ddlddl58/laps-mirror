c   this function returns the temperature tsa (celsius) on a saturation
c   adiabat at pressure p (millibars). os is the equivalent potential
c   temperature of the parcel (celsius). sign(a,b) replaces the
c   algebraic sign of a with that of b.
c   b is an empirical constant approximately equal to 0.001 of the latent 
c   heat of vaporization for water divided by the specific heat at constant
c   pressure for dry air.

	data b/2.6518986/
	a= os+273.15

c   tq is the first guess for tsa.

	tq= 253.15

c   d is an initial value used in the iteration below.

	d= 120.

c   iterate to obtain sufficient accuracy....see table 1, p.8
c   of stipanuk (1973) for equation used in iteration.

	do 1 i= 1,12
	   tqk= tq-273.15
	   d= d/2.
	   x= a*exp(-b*w(tqk,p)/tq)-tq*((1000./p)**.286)
	   if (abs(x).lt.1e-7) go to 2
	   tq= tq+sign(d,x)
 1	continue
 2	tsa= tq-273.15
	return
	end
