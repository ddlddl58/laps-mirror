c   this function returns the wet-bulb potential temperature ow
c   (celsius) given the temperature t (celsius), dew point td
c   (celsius), and pressure p (millibars).  the calculation for ow is
c   very similar to that for wet bulb temperature. see p.13 stipanuk (1973).
c   find the wet bulb temperature of the parcel

	atw = tw(t,td,p)

c   find the equivalent potential temperature of the parcel.

	aos= os(atw,p)

c   find the wet-bulb potential temperature.

	ow= tsa(aos,1000.)
	return
	end
