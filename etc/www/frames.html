Animations can be made by selecting a #Frames value greater than 1. Time
intervals are counted in terms of the analysis cycle time. 
The "auto-1" setting
will show an animation for each LAPS cycle between the initial and valid times.
The "auto-3" setting can be used for model forecasts, when the forecast time step
is a factor of 3 longer than the analysis time step.

These images are animated GIF files. They can be downloaded onto disk
from this "on-the-fly" page and used for things like powerpoint files or other web displays.

Animation frame rate is controlled by the "Delay" setting where the frame
interval is in hundredths of a second (e.g. 100 = 1.00 seconds).
