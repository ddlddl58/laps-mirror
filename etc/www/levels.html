<h2>Level(s):</h2>
For a horizontal view, enter one of more of the numerical pressure levels.
These levels are given in millibars (hPa). As a rough guide, 1000mb would
be near the sea level, 850mb is about 5000 feet elevation, 700mb is 10000
feet. 500mb is 18000 feet. 300 mb is 30000 feet, and 100mb is 50000 feet.
