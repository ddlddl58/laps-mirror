c OVERALL LAPS PARAMETERS
c Many of these are stored in the common block in 'lapsparms.cmn'
c
c c6_maproj - map projection 'lambrt', 'plrstr', or 'merctr'
c
c NX_L - number of grid points in the horizontal direction
c 
c NY_L - number of grid points in the vertical direction
c
c vertical_grid - type of vertical grid coordinate
c                 'PRESSURE' means constant pressure grid, uses pressures.nl
c                 'SIGMA_P' means sigma pressure grid, uses sigmas.nl (under development)
c                 'SIGMA_HT' means sigma height grid, uses heights.nl (under development)
c
c earth_radius - assumed spherical earth radius in meters
c
c laps_cycle_time - LAPS cycle time in seconds. This is the interval
c                   between successive LAPS analyses and should correspond
c                   to the interval between cron entries that run the
c                   'sched.pl' script.
c
c purge_time - default retention time for files to use with the purger (days)
c
c path_to_soil_2m - this parameter is not yet active since we do not yet
c                   supply the soil type database. It is there only for
c                   software testing at this time.
c
c l_superob_barnes - use superobing routine for the 3-D wind and temperature 
c                    analyses
c
c l_mosaic_sat - allow mosaicing of multiple satellite LVD inputs (under
c                development)
c
c l_accum_fg - use first guess model info in the precip accumulation analysis
c
c l_accum_radar - use radar in the precip accumulation analysis
c
c l_accum_gauge - use rain gauges in the precip accumulation analysis 
c                 (beyond point pair comparisons that are done regardless)
c
c l_compress_radar - Compress "vxx" radar files using run-length encoding.
c                    Note that this is experimental and departs from the 
c                    NetCDF file convention
c
c l_use_tamdar - Flag to decide to block the use of TAMDAR ACARS research data. 
c                This flag functions only when the NIMBUS database is being 
c                used. Operational TAMDAR is always allowed. For the WFO 
c                database, the research & operational TAMDAR data are always 
c                allowed through if they are available.
c
c c_raddat_type - selects type of NOWRAD radar data ('wsi', or 'wfo') used by 
c                 the 'vrc_driver.x' program
c
c maxstns - max number of sfc stations you are likely to encounter in the
c         - LSO file and various analyses, in and near the domain.
c         - used in obs_driver.x, sfc_qc.exe, laps_sfc.x, and others?
c
c max_snd_grid - Total number of temperature profiles allowed
c
c max_snd_levels - Maximum number of temperature sounding levels allowed
c
c redp_lvl (Pressure reduction):  The main pressure analysis that LAPS
c               produces is a reduction to this elevation (m).  For example,
c               the Colorado LAPS uses 1500 m, about the elevation of
c               Denver, since it is representative of the elevations in the 
c               region of interest. In general this reference height should be 
c               approximately equal to the mean elevation of stations reporting
c               surface pressure (altimeter setting) or station pressure.
c
c radarext_3d - Determines input radar source for the cloud analysis.
c               Intermediate files used are already on the LAPS grid.
c               'all' first use 'vrz' 3D mosaic, then merge in 'lapsprd/vrc'
c               'a01' first use 'v01' volume data, then merge in 'lapsprd/vrc'
c               'v01' (radar #1  volume data)
c               'v02' (radar #2  volume data)
c               'vxx' (radar #xx volume data)
c               'vrc' (2d radar data [e.g. NOWRAD, NEXRAD Lvl 3 narrowband])
c
c radarext_3d_accum - Determines input radar source for precip accum analysis.
c                     Intermediate files used are already on the LAPS grid.
c                     'xxx' Choose 'vrc' or 'all' automatically based on
c                           availability and frequency of 'vrc/vrz'.
c                     'vrc' (2d radar data in lapsprd directory [e.g. NOWRAD, 
c                                                     NEXRAD Lvl 3, narrowband]  )
c                     'vrz' (radar volume mosaic data)
c                     'all' first use 'vrz', then merge in 'lapsprd/vrc'
c                           at the times 'vrz' is present
c                     'v01' (radar #1  volume data)
c                     'v02' (radar #2  volume data)
c                     'vxx' (radar #xx volume data)
c                     'non' radar will not be used (i.e. is withheld)
c
c path_to_topt30s - Path to LAPS topography database.
c                   If this contains the string 'wps', a WRF GEOGRID file can
c                   instead be imported, provided it is on the same grid as
c                   LAPS.
c
c path_to_raw_blpprofiler - Path to Boundary Layer wind profiler data. If 
c                           data is Multi-Agency MADIS then use 'WFO' for 
c                           'c8_project'.
c
c path_to_raw_blprass - Path to Boundary Layer RASS data. If data is 
c                       Multi-Agency MADIS then use 'WFO' for 
c                       'c8_project'.
c
c iverbose - amount of log file output (0,1)
c
c MAX_RADARS - Number of wideband radars being used. This can be set to
c              0 if no radars are present to save computer memory 
c              (particularly in the wind analysis) along with other 
c              resources.
c
c aod - aerosol optical depth integrated through the column (treated as a
c       constant over the horizontal domain)
c
c max_radar_files_nl - Maximum number of files expected in a radar directory
c
c ref_base - Reflectivity dbZ value assigned to areas with no echoes detected
c            by a radar scan. Note that areas where the radar hasn't scanned 
c            are normally given the more general missing value of 
c            'r_missing_data', unless something like first guess information
c            is being used to fill in.
c
c ref_base_useable - Threshold dbZ used to filter out low reflectivities 
c                    thus acting as a ground clutter and noise filter.
c                    Areas with reflectivities < 'ref_base_useable'
c                    are generally reset to 'ref_base' (no echo 
c                    value).
c                      
c r_hybrid_first_gate - Flag to mask out gates near the radar for low tilts to 
c                       emulate what happens with the hybrid reflectivity scan.
c                       Allowed values are 0.0 (flag off) or 1.0 (flag on).
c
c aircraft_time_window - Time window (half width) for accepting aircraft 
c                        data in both the PIN file and in the analyses. 
c                        Measured as a fraction of 'laps_cycle_time'.
c
c
c fdda_model_source - Enter the forecast model if you'd like to use
c                     one for 4DDA (as a substitute for lga/lgb input
c                     to the analyses). Examples are 'mm5', 'eta', etc. 
c                     This corresponds to the available 'lapsprd/fua/*'
c                     subdirectories. Lapsplot will plot only among those
c                     listed elements. The list of models (other than lga)
c                     is used for reference during localization and 
c                     verification. 'lga' is generally specified as the
c                     first element and is ignored during the verification.
c
c model_cycle_time - Time between successive model initializations (seconds) 
c
c model_fcst_intvl - Time between model forecast steps within a given run (seconds)
c
c model_fcst_len - Total duration of model forecast (minutes)
c
c
c iwrite_output - flag to write out all little files or just a restricted set
c                 (1)  means write out all little files
c                 (0)  means write out restricted set for single executable
c                 (-1) means doesn't write out any little files
c
c TERRAIN SMOOTHING
c           
c toptwvl_parm: 
c     As an example, 4. would represent 4 delta-x filtering of the terrain. You
c     can change this to alter the smoothness of the terrain. Higher numbers 
c     mean smoother terrain. Minimum value should be 2 since setting to 0
c     would cause the run to fail. We generally use even numbers (e.g. 2., 4., 
c     or 6.)
c
c silavwt_parm : 
c     This parameter allows the potential use of silhouette terrain which is 
c     the maximum elevation in the local area. Useful range is anywhere 
c     between 0-1. A value of zero uses the average terrain instead of the 
c     maximum. Note that a value of 1 may reduce the apparent effect of 
c     filtering with 'toptwvl_parm'.
c
c c8_project - Depends on which "realization" of LAPS you are running.
c              This sends information to various programs on things
c              like file formats, filename conventions, etc. Most 
c              references to 'c8_project' are in the ingest
c              routines, though it also controls other specialized 
c              functions for 'AIRDROP'. Allowed values are 'NIMBUS', 
c              'WFO', 'AFWA', 'CWB', 'RSA', and 'AIRDROP'.
c
c c8_blpfmt - Specify the format of boundary layer profiler data
c             If set to 'default' the software will key off of the
c             value of 'c8_project'. Otherwise it can be
c             explicitly set to 'MADIS' as an override.
